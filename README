Think-Blast is a space shooter game that uses a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) to control the player-ship. A second player (co-pilot) uses the keyboard to control other movements of the ship, so the game is two-player co-op only. Think-Blast requires the use of an openBCI Cyton to provide BCI functionality.
